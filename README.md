# Firewall-Rules-to-Restrict-and-Allow-Specific-Traffic

Project Overview
This project aims to demonstrate the use of pfSense firewall rules to control outbound traffic, restricting access to non-educational sites like gaming platforms (e.g., Roblox and Minecraft) while allowing only essential web browsing. The task includes configuring TCP and UDP rules to enable controlled traffic, then using Host Overrides in pfSense to block specific gaming sites. This project serves as an introduction to firewall rules, DNS configuration, and troubleshooting communication issues between virtual machines.

## Real-World Scenario: School Lab with Restricted Internet Access
In a school setting, administrators often need to ensure that pupils can access only educational content and websites. The goal is to prevent students from accessing specific gaming sites like Roblox.com and Mindcraft.net.
